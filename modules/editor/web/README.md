# Sequence Diagram Editor for WSO2 Integration Server

This module includes two main features for modeling integration workflows in WSO2 Integration Server.

- Design View
    
    In design view, an integration workflow can be visually designed using sequence diagram elements. 
    It provides a tool palette, canvas and a property window for designing sequence diagrams.

- Source View

    The source view can be used for writing the integration workflow in text format. The text editor 
    provides intellisense and language support required.
